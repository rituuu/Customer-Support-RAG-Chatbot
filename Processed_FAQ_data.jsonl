Potential root cause: Faulty power source. Remedy: Check the power outlet. 1. Connect the unit into a different wall outlet. 2. Ensure the power button is ON. 3. Use a tester to check whether there is proper supply of electric current to the point. 4. Make sure the plug has been inserted properly. Potential root cause: Physical damaged. Remedy: Check for the physical damaged. 1. Check and ensure that there is no physical damaged to the product. 2. Make sure there is no twist or break to the power cable. 3. Confirm the exact issue from customer whether it is a self induced damage or the damaged product received by customer at the time of delivery. If it is not self induced damage and customer is calling within return window, post verification of images provide resolution as per SOP. I am unable to acquire water from my purifier. Potential root cause: Unknown. Remedy: Check for the following procedure. 1. Check the RO Storage Tank Pressure: a. Check the RO storage tank to make sure it's properly pressurized. Note: Pressure that's too high or too low could affect the water flow. b. Always check the manual/user guide for the specific issues. 2. Check the Water Supply Access: a. Check and ensure the water supply is turned back ON after any maintenance process. 3. Check Low Water Pressure: a. Check water pressure rests below 40 psi, the water flow often slows to nothing. b. Adjust the water flow accordingly to see the flow rise to normal levels. I am unable to get the hot water. Potential root cause: Storage tank is empty. Remedy: Check and ensure that the storage tank is filled appropriately. 1. Wait until the storage tank gets filled. Potential root cause: Fault in check valve. Remedy: Contact the manufacturer. 1. Contact the manufacturer for further assistance. I am unable to stop my water filter from leaking. Potential root cause: Membrane is leaking water around the connection points. Remedy: Check the following procedure. 1. Shut OFF the water supply going to the leaking water filter by turning a ball valve lever 1/4 turn (90 degrees). 2. Depressurize filter by turning on water faucet after the system until water stops. 3. Shut OFF the water after filter if possible. 4. Unscrew the leaking filter housing. I am getting a decreased flow of purified water. Potential root cause: Tap/ball valve is closed. Remedy: Check the valve. 1. Make sure the tap/ball valve is opened. Potential root cause: Nozzle is blocked. Remedy: Check the filter. 1. Make sure the storage tank must be full for proper water pressure. 2. Check and ensure there is no dust particles in the pipe tank. 3. Keep extra filters handy and replacement needs to be done on a regular basis or whenever the water flow begins to slow. Potential root cause: RO membrane/filters may be clogged or damaged. Remedy: Check the RO membrane/filters. 1. Contact Amazon for the filters replacement, if applicable. Note : If product was damaged, Amazon will replace the product, not the manufacturer. My purifiers reject water tube is not working. Potential root cause: Reject water tube is bent. Remedy: Check and ensure there is no bent or break to the reject water tube. 1. Clear the bent in the reject water tube. 2. Replace the bent tube with a new one. Potential root cause: Reject water tube is blocked. Remedy: Contact the manufacturer. 1. Switch OFF the Water purifier. 2. If the pipe is loose and the pump is sucking in air, then that air gets trapped inside the purifier and prevents it from working. There is also another reason for the presence of air vaccum inside the purifier. The pre-filter was blocked, will not let the water pass through and creating a vaccum. My purifiers water smells unpleasant. Potential root cause: Purified water been stored in the tank for a long time. Note: Avoid letting the system go unused for longer period/days. Remedy: Remove the water from the purifier. 1. 1. Drain the stored water from the storage tank through faucet. 2. When sulfur finds it's way into the water, it gives bad taste and smell. 3. Puifier might be having damaged filters or membranes, which letting sulfur molecules pass through into the water. Furthermore, improper sanitation of Reverse Osmosis Equipment will give bad taste of water. Potential root cause: RO membrane/filters may require replacement. Remedy: Replace the RO membrane/filters. 1. Ensure to replace the membrane when you notice its efficacy dropping. 2. Ideally RO membrane needs replacement every 8-12 months, but also largely depends upon the consumption. 3. Sediment and carbon filters will need a change once every three months and UV light annually. The salt get accumulated on the surface of the membrane can reduce the performance of water purifier. Note : We follow these troubleshooting steps when customer called within return window. If they need a RO membrane/filters, they need to contact manufacture.

Position your feet flat on the floor, shoulder's width apart, and an equal distance away from your body. This sitting posture should be solid and comfortable. When you sit on the stool your knees should be bent at an (almost) 90-degree angle. Hips should be slightly higher than knees. Don't have the stool set too low. If your knees are higher than your hips it can lead to unnecessary strain on the hips and upper legs. Pedals: Now put the pedals where your feet are. If you're setting up a right-handed/right-footed drum kit the bass drum pedal will be under your right foot and the hi hat pedal will be under your left foot. If you use a double bass drum pedal the additional pedal can be positioned after the rest of the kit has been put in place.

Align the pedal: Slide the pedal's clamp or attachment bracket around the hoop of the bass drum. It should be positioned in such a way that the pedal is centered in front of the drum. Secure the clamp: Tighten the clamp or attachment screw to secure the pedal to the bass drum hoop. Make sure it's tight enough that the pedal doesn't move during use but not so tight that it damages the hoop. Adjust the beater: Adjust the beater's distance from the drumhead to your preferred setting. The beater should be positioned so that it makes contact with the drumhead at an optimal angle when the pedal is fully pressed. Check the angle: Make sure the pedal's footboard is positioned comfortably and the pedal action feels smooth. You can adjust the tension of the spring at the back of the pedal to fine-tune the resistance."}]}

Whichever type of tom mounting system you use; you should be able to find a suitable angle and position for the toms. These should be in easy reach without having to stretch or lean forwards. Cymbals should be above the kit so that to play them you move your arms upwards, not forwards. Just like the idea you applied to the position of the toms. The heads on your drums should be in good condition (without holes or large dents), and the proper heads for top and bottom should be used (bottom heads are thinner, which allows the drum to resonate)."}]}

Make sure that there are no slack tension points or wrinkles in any area of the head. Check the lugs once again for equal tension.  Cross tensioning starting with the tension rod in the 12 o'clock position, tighten it 1/2 turn with a drum key.  Move across the drum until you have tuned all the rods equally. Continue in this manner until you reach the desired pitch. How high or low a drum is tuned is a matter of personal preference.  Pick one tension rod as a reference point and begin to use small turns of the key to match the pitch of the other rods to it. Muffling Once you have the drums tuned, you may wish to apply a small amount of muffling to control the sustain - either with a small cloth patch, moleskin, \"moongel,\" duct tape or gaff tape. A good sounding drum should have some resonance, or sustained tone. Note: The batter head on the snare drum should be tight enough for the stick to rebound easily. Fine Tuning Once you tighten the head into the desired pitch range, tap the drum with your finger, stick or drum key at each tension rod and listen for a pitch (it might be helpful to place the drum on a rug or towel to isolate the sound of the head your tuning). 6.
